<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>The last two posts were a bit dense so we‚Äôll try to keep it simple here.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with a morbid stat: if you‚Äôre younger than 30 and live in the United States, your most probable cause of death is a car crash.</p>

<p>You may have already known that. But here‚Äôs a kicker - your risk of dying in a car crash is heavily influenced by the city you live in. And although metropolitan density is an obvious factor, other variables including weather, state policy, type of car involved, and emergency response capabilities play a <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state#fn1ref1">huge role</a>.</p>

<p>In this post, we‚Äôll be using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> - R‚Äôs de-facto plotting package <sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> - to explore the relationship between city and motor vehicle fatalities in the US between 2010 and 2016.</p>

<p>We‚Äôll be using data compiled from the <a href="https://www.bigcitieshealth.org">Big Cities Health Coalition</a>, a partnership organization comprised of public health leaders and thinkers from America‚Äôs largest cities. I‚Äôd never heard of BCHC prior to this and I was genuinely impressed with the wealth of data and analyses published on their site.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>In the 1950‚Äôs, the United States mortality rate due to motor vehicle crashes was about <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110921222129/http://www.saferoads.org/federal/2004/TrafficFatalities1899-2003.pdf">22 per 100,000</a> population. That proportion peaked at about 26 in the early 1970‚Äôs and has since been steadily falling. Despite a somewhat alarming uptick in 2015, the proportion today hovers at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110921222129/http://www.saferoads.org/federal/2004/TrafficFatalities1899-2003.pdf">11 per 100,000</a>.</p>

<p>While that‚Äôs undoubtedly huge progress, it still means that more than <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/winnablebattles/report/motor.html">35,000</a> people die as a result of a motor vehicle crash every year. According to the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/motor-vehicle-safety/index.html">CDC</a>, about 1/3 of fatalities involve drunk drivers, another 1/3 involve drivers or passengers where proper restraints were not used (meaning seat belts, car seats, etc.), and another 1/3 involve drivers that were speeding.</p>

<p>Another somewhat sad statistic is that the reduction in motor vehicle fatalities in the U.S. has not kept pace with that of other high income countries. On average, high income countries reduced crash deaths by 56% between 2000 and 2013, compared with 31% in the U.S <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/motor-vehicle-safety/index.html">CDC</a>. Today, the mortality rate in the U.S. (the 11 per 100,000 mentioned above) is by far the highest among high-income countries.</p>

<p>Interestingly, states that are predominantly rural tend to have higher vehicle mortality rates. Mississippi (22.5 deaths/100,000 population), South Carolina (20.4 deaths/100,000 population), and Alabama (19.5 deaths/100,000 population) represent the highest rates, while New York (4.8 deaths/100,000 population), Massachusetts (5.2 deaths/100,000 population), and New Jersey (6.3 deaths/100,000 population) represent three of the lowest <a href="https://www.iihs.org/topics/fatality-statistics/detail/state-by-state">IIHS</a>. However, this divide is much less clear when we drill down to individual cities. Cary, NC, for instance, is one of the safest cities for drivers (1.3 fatal accidents per 100,000 population), while Detroit is one of the most dangerous (16.2 fatal accidents per 100,000 population) <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/insurance/dangerous-cities-car-drivers-2016/">Nerdwallet</a>.</p>

<p>Ok, enough sad statistics. Let‚Äôs look at some data.</p>

<p>We want to make sure that the variable types R gives us are correct, variables are appropriately named, and that everything we expected in the dataframe is indeed there.

<p>It looks like things are pretty clean. Most of the categorical variables, including race, sex, and city were read in as factors, while the mortality values and corresponding confidence intervals were read in using the double class. The only thing to fix is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">source</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">methods</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notes</code> variables, which should technically be strings since they don‚Äôt contain any logical levels. I‚Äôm also going to change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">year</code> to a categorical variable so R doesn‚Äôt get confused trying to analyze it continuously.</p>

<h2 id="visualizing-motor-vehicle-fatalities">Visualizing Motor Vehicle Fatalities</h2>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> works by layering graphical elements on top of one another. These layers are referred to as ‚Äúgeoms‚Äù and they include things like axes, grid lines, color schemes points representing your data, trend-lines connecting your data, shaded regions representing confidence intervals, and plot labels, titles, and legends. Creating a final graph requires you to define each element individually and ‚Äúadd‚Äù it to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot()</code> call.</p>

<p>The best way to explain <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> is, of course, to demonstrate it. Let‚Äôs first just apply the function to our dataframe <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">drive_df</code> to see what happens.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">drive_df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w"> 
  </span><span class="n">ggplot</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/figs/2020-07-17-car-crashes/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-1" /></p>

<p>We get this lovely gray square. Who doesn‚Äôt love gray squares?</p>

<p>This may seem silly but the point is to demonstrate that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> needs you to state what you want.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is tell <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> what our dependent and independent variables are. We‚Äôre interested in motor vehicle mortality year over year, so let‚Äôs try the following:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">drive_df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w"> 
  </span><span class="n">ggplot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">year</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/figs/2020-07-17-car-crashes/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-2" /></p>

<p>Wait what?</p>

<p>And this is one of the first lessons of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code>. In order to control how things look within a geom, you have to set what are known as <strong>aesthetics</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="aesthetics">Aesthetics</h3>

<p>Aesthetics set within the ggplot function itself (i.e. before geoms are defined) are global aesthetics that apply to the entire plot. Aesthetics set within a geom apply only to that geom. Therefore, when we define axes, we want to set them globally within a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot(aes()</code> call:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">drive_df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w"> 
  </span><span class="n">ggplot</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">aes</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">x</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">year</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">y</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">value</span><span class="p">))</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/figs/2020-07-17-car-crashes/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-3" /></p>

<p>Ah, now we‚Äôre getting somewhere.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs attempt to create a plot of motor vehicle mortality as a function of year. We know that we have data from 2010 through 2016 and that the data are collected (or compiled) annually. In order to get some points for each year, we‚Äôll need to ‚Äúadd‚Äù a point geom to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code>:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">drive_df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w">

  </span><span class="n">geom_point</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w">

<p><img src="/figs/2020-07-17-car-crashes/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" alt="plot of chunk unnamed-chunk-4" height="600px" width="600px" /></p>

<p>Clearly this is a pretty bad plot and if you ever see something like this published, please assume that the author doesn‚Äôt know much about plots. For one thing, using a scatterplot doesn‚Äôt make sense because the year variable was measured categorically rather than continuously. BUT‚Ä¶ this does show us something important in the data: <strong>outliers</strong>. On the left, we have points hovering at 70-75 deaths per 100,000. Recall that in the 1970s, when motor vehicle deaths peaked, the average values reached into the mid-20s. So clearly, 75 is astronomical. Let‚Äôs take a detour and investigate this a bit more. I‚Äôm going to go back to the dataframe and sort in order of decreasing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">value</code>:</p>

<p>The top three outliers belong to 2011 Denver, CO (74.4 deaths), 2012 Denver, CO (also 74.4 deaths), and 2010 Minneapolis, MN (70.5 deaths). What‚Äôs important is that these are race-stratified. While all three represent total values for both males and females, the Denver numbers represent data for race labeled ‚ÄúOther‚Äù and the Minneapolis number belongs to the American Indian/Alaska Native population. If we wanted to dig around, we could perhaps find the original Denver and Minneapolis data and double check these numbers. They might be correct or they might be attributed to typos.</p>

<p>In this case, we‚Äôre not interested in racial distribution for the moment, so we‚Äôre going to restrict our dataset to the collapsed values, meaning those representing the averages of both sexes and all races. Then we‚Äôll re-attempt the pseudo-scatterplot.</p>

<p>Ok, that‚Äôs a little better, but it still doesn‚Äôt tell us anything interesting. Each year has many data points representing an individual city and on this plot, it‚Äôs impossible to tell which city corresponds to which point. We‚Äôll come back to this question in a moment, but for now, let‚Äôs try to extract something useful from the plot. Let‚Äôs try to answer the question: <strong>on average, did motor vehicle fatalities in the U.S. increase, decrease, or remain stable between 2010 and 2016?</strong> To visualize the answer, we‚Äôll need a plot that can show us the center value of each year, and maybe some indication of the distribution within that year. Enter the boxplot.</p>

<h3 id="boxplots">Boxplots</h3>

<p>I love a good boxplot (perhaps even more than I love a good gray square). Here‚Äôs a wonderful TDS <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-boxplots-5e2df7bcbd51">post</a> on boxplots.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs quickly toss in a boxplot geom:</p>

<p>Brilliant! Immediately we gleaned a useful nugget of information: there was an alarming spike in the data. Things were chugging along and then something happened in 2015. If you do a news search on this topic, you‚Äôll see that public health and safety folks <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/02/18/467230965/2015-traffic-fatalities-rose-by-largest-percent-in-50-years-safety-group-says">noticed</a> this, too. It looks like fuel prices and job growth were potential culprits, but either way, this is clearly a very useful insight.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs spice this plot up a bit. Let‚Äôs say we want to compare men and women in the same time frame. We will need to specify a color code within the aesthetic for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">geom_boxplot</code> and we‚Äôll also need to filter out the ‚ÄúBoth‚Äù values for sex, since we just want male vs female.</p>

<p>NICE. These are meaty results. There‚Äôs an obvious disparity in mortality between males and females. Most years, male fatality averages are more than double that of females, and some years (2015, for instance) it‚Äôs more like triple. The female boxplot for 2016 also looks suspiciously narrow. It‚Äôs worth investigating but for now let‚Äôs move on.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm not a huge fan of that color scheme, so let‚Äôs use some nicer colors. For two-tone plots, I like to just manually choose the colors (there are a million color tools online, but <a href="https://coolors.co">this one</a> is my favorite). For three or more colors, I normally use a package like <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/RColorBrewer.pdf"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RColorBrewer</code></a> (built-in) or the extra-fancy <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">viridis</code></a> package, which you‚Äôd need to install. I‚Äôm also going to get rid of the gray background using a theme and change the opacity of the fill color using an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alpha</code> statement (the latter is just personal preference). Finally, I‚Äôll capitalize the axis labels, and add a title and caption.</p>

<p>Great, we wound up with a nice-looking boxplot with some useful information.</p>

<h3 id="violin-plots">Violin Plots</h3>

<p>Now let‚Äôs take a look at a cousin of the boxplot: the violin plot. All you really need to know to understand how it works is shown in this figure, taken from another <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/violin-plots-explained-fb1d115e023d">TDS post</a>.</p>

<figure class="half">
    <img src="/assets/images/violin.png" />
</figure>

<p>There was a time a few years back when everyone thought violin plots were the best thing since sliced bagels. The trend seems to have somewhat faded but I think they‚Äôre nice so let‚Äôs make one.</p>

<p>Is it just me or do these look like a Dr. Seuss version of stick-figures?</p>

<p>Anyway, these aren‚Äôt very ‚Äúviolin-y‚Äù but the point is that higher frequencies of values lead to wider parts of the plots and vice-versa. If we want to see a more violin shape, we can combine some of the years to get more data points per ‚Äòviolin‚Äù. Let‚Äôs do that here:</p>

<p>Much more violin-like! Clearly, the 2010-2012 group had most of its data points in the 6-6.5 range, while 2013-2016 was a bit more spread out across its range of values and its median is a bit higher (probably driven by that alarming 2015 number).</p>

<p>What if we split out males vs females like we did in our boxplots?</p>

<p>All right, let‚Äôs get extra fancy. We‚Äôre going to use a function within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stat_summary</code> to give us some extra detail.</p>

<h4 id="stat_summary"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stat_summary()</code></h4>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stat_summary</code> does just what it sounds like - it summarizes stats. We‚Äôve been using stats within our geoms this whole time, we just didn‚Äôt know about it because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> does it in the background. For instance, the boxplot geom calculates the median, 25th, and 75th percentile stats.</p>

<p>Here, we‚Äôll add dots to indicate the median in each violin. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">position_dodge</code> function moves the dots inside the violins, as opposed to positioning them directly on the gridline.</p>

<p>There are lots of other stats you can layer on. You can even embed little boxplots within the violin plots. <a href="http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/ggplot2-violin-plot-quick-start-guide-r-software-and-data-visualization">This page</a> gives a great summary, but for our purposes we‚Äôre going to end our mini-tour of violin plots here and move on.</p>

<p>Every dot represents a city and every city has a value for every year of measurement, so of course we want to know which dot belongs to which city.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs start with some basic color-coding.</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">drive_df</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">%&gt;%</span><span class="w">

<p>Yikes. It‚Äôs basically impossible to distinguish any of these colors from one another, or to follow the trajectory of any city year to year. We need lines rather than dots. We also need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> to know that each city should be treated as a grouping (this latter point is not super intuitive to me, but just know that it doesn‚Äôt work otherwise).</p>

<p>That‚Äôs a lot better, but there‚Äôs still no way anyone would be able to distinguish Houston from Indianapolis, or even be able to infer which city has the highest crash fatality burden versus lowest. And this is where interactivity comes in handy.</p>

<p>A word of warning, it‚Äôs easy to over-do interactivity and go nuts with things like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> because it‚Äôs fun and flashy. Don‚Äôt do it. If it doesn‚Äôt add value to visualizing patterns in the data, it doesn‚Äôt have any place on your plot.</p>

<h3 id="ggplotly"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplotly</code></h3>

<p>In this case, we definitely want some interactivity to help us understand the data. We‚Äôre going to use <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/plotly/versions/4.9.2.1/topics/ggplotly"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplotly</code></a>, a convenient marriage of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code>.

<p>Isn‚Äôt this amazing? I‚Äôm blown away that one additional line of code did all that.</p>

<h3 id="faceting">Faceting</h3>

<p>Ok, one last trick. Say we wanted to give each city its own little plot to understand time-trends within the city. We can certainly get this information from the spaghetti plot but it would undoubtedly cause a headache. Let‚Äôs play with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">facet_wrap</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">facet_grid</code> instead.</p>

<p>The difference between these two isn‚Äôt super clear to start with, but basically, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">facet_wrap</code> is good if you‚Äôre just faceting on one variable (in our case, city). If you want to end up with a separate mini-plot for each combination of two variables (for instance, a mini-plot for female fatalities in Denver, another plot for male fatalities in Denver, and so on for every combination of city and sex), you want <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">facet_grid</code> (more info <a href="https://ggplot2-book.org/facet.html">here</a>).</p>

<p>We‚Äôre going to start with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">facet_wrap</code>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm pretty happy with that. It‚Äôs clear we have an issue with Indianapolis (perhaps they only provide the combined male/female figure but not the individual values). It‚Äôs also clear that Boston had only 2 years of data and other cities have some missing data as well. But a more interesting finding is comparing Denver to Detroit, which are conveniently side-by-side. Detroit saw a leveling off, whereas Denver saw a sharp increase in male fatalities. San Jose sticks out, too, as the only city where female fatalities surpassed male fatalities (and sharply so‚Ä¶) If I were an analyst looking at traffic safety, I‚Äôd put some focus on Denver and San Jose and figure out what‚Äôs going on there.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I hope you agree that we did some fun stuff and learned a bit about car crash fatalities. My takeaways were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a huge disparity between male and female motor vehicle fatalities in nearly every big city in the U.S., males experiencing double and sometimes triple the female average fatality rate.</li>
  <li>Detroit has historically had the highest burden of motor vehicle fatalities, but Denver has recently caught up.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> is very cool. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplotly</code> is also very cool.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is absolutely just a surface-scratch of all the things <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code> can do, so please take a look at the links below for more complete package exploration.</p>

      <p>Age adjustment is a method used in epidemiology when comparing rates of disease or mortality between populations with different age breakdowns. Roughly speaking, if the population of Austin TX, for instance, is much younger than the average U.S. population, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to compare mortality rates directly. We know that older people die more frequently than younger people, so if we want an apples-to-apples comparison of two populations we have to use a weighting scheme. And that‚Äôs all age standardization is - a weighting scheme that assigns more weight to certain age categories to ‚Äúequalize‚Äù their weight to that of the reference population. In our example, older people in Austin would get weighted more than younger people.¬†<a href="#fnref:2" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
