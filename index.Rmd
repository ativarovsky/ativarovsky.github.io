## About

Hi there. I'm Alice and I'm a second-year MPH student at [Columbia Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu), studying Epidemiology and Biostatistics. I'm passionate about using data to improve health outcomes. If you're an employer, please make your way over to my [résumé](resume.html) and/or [LinkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-tivarovsky-56281131/).

## Work

* If data science is my favorite pastime, eating is close second. Check out some [NYC restaurant analyses](restaurant_dashboard.html) I ran. 
* I completed the Health Research Training Program (HRTP) with the [New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/index.page) in summer 2019. I analyzed depression rates across NYC. Check out my final poster [here](practicum.html).
* In Fall 2019, I worked on an [analysis](https://prisrinivasan.github.io/p8105_final/index.html) of associations between childhood asthma prevalence and cockraoch presence in NYC households.
