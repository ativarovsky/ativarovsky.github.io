# Slides

Making websites is good for displaying your work. The internet used to be weird. Before google, there was geocities, which was a directory where you found websites by topic. You don't need to know html because we've learned RMD. It's sometimes helpful to embed html, but the parts you need to know are easy. 

But knowing RMD is half the battle. You need a host. This is what we use Github for. Here, we will create a personal website on Github. 

# Example

## Creating a repo

I created a Github repo called ativarovsky.github.io. 

## Getting started

We start with an index html, downloaded from the course website, and saved in this repo. The test website is on that repo. 

## Common Content

Your website can include text, of course; you can also include code and figures generated from analyses. Like I keep saying, you’re writing in RMD.

One important feature of your site will be hyperlinks. The general format for links is [text for link](address.of.link). So, to link to my favorite tool for data science, I’d use [this](google.com).

Your website usually has more than one page. These pages can be created using the same process as index.html: create an Rmd file and knit to html. Once you have another page (e.g. about.html) you need to link to it from your home page (e.g. using use [about](about.html)), or no one will be able to find it.

Sometimes you want to add images – pictures you’ve taken or found on the internets, rather than things that are generated from analyses. This is a bit more involved than other things you might want to do. RMD’s default image settings (using ![](image.jpg)) aren’t great. I often use a line of HTML:

<img src="images/image.jpg" style="width:75%">

This will load and display images/image.jpg (I usually keep my images inside an images folder to reduce clutter). The style components control things like adding a border or adjusting the image height or width, along with lots of other things – googling around can help if you want to change the style settings. If you want your style rules to apply to all images it can be easier to write a short CSS file, but that’s beyond what we’re going to do now.
